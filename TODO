        [12:37] Aiden_Garth: Pull created. Link: https://github.com/rhymu8354/Mines/pull/1
        The test build failed; looks like `typescript` needs to be added to the project in order for the build to work.
        Aiden_Garth submitted closed the original PR and opened a second PR, which they got working.  I merged it into master, so now various TypeScript-enabled checking features are enabled for VSCode even for plain JavaScript.

    ✔ Fix version number not showing up in production @created(2020-04-20 11:23) @done(2020-04-23 15:13)
        I looked into this and it appears Vercel (now.sh) ignores the `.env` file when making the deployment.  I searched around a bit but could not find any convenient way to reuse the `version` number from `package.json` automatically in the production build.
        -12:51] HiDeo: Rhymu I use Secrets for this and this can be automated at predeploy time https://vercel.com/docs/now-cli#commands/secrets
        I ended up using RomaniaHate's implementation (https://discordapp.com/channels/502343471437185025/502344892408659968/703000548101718127)

        This could be localStorage-based, or we could have scores submitted to a global leaderboard if we have some way to detect or prevent cheating (of if we don't care about cheating).

    ✔ [5:43] nDoorn: Might to be an idea to make the numbers left/right clickable. Left clicking makes them darker and right clicking them makes them show normally.
